# cheapster-js
This is a project that was born during a 24h marathon of programming, which by the way, we won it.

The purpose of the project, in this beta version, is to manage the rounds, of coffee, beer, etc, between friends, who regularly
go out on one of those activities. However, this does not involve their money, it only keeps track of who's turn is to pay.

This project was created with javascript using the Meteor framework and the databse MongoDB.

To run this project, you will need to install Meteor in your machine. If you're using a mac or a linux OS, just run the following
command in the terminal: curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh

To run the project, just put the command: Meteor

It will work in the localhost 3000.

Have fun, and any feedback is well appreciated.
